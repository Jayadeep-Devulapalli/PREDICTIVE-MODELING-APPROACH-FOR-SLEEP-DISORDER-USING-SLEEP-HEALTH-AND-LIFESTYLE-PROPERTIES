# PREDICTIVE-MODELING-APPROACH-FOR-SLEEP-DISORDER-USING-SLEEP-HEALTH-AND-LIFESTYLE-PROPERTIES
The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset is a comprehensive collection of sleep and lifestyle-
related variables for 400 individuals, providing valuable insights into sleep patterns, daily
habits, and potential sleep disorders. By analyzing physical activity levels, stress, and BMI
categories, healthcare professionals can design personalized lifestyle interventions to improve
overall health and well-being. The presence or absence of sleep disorders, such as Insomnia
and Sleep Apnea, allows for the identification of individuals at risk and informs targeted
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Previous research on sleep health and lifestyle factors
often relies on self-reported data, which may introduce biases and inaccuracies. Subjective
sleep quality assessments may not capture objective sleep measurements accurately.
Additionally, existing studies lack comprehensive datasets, hindering the ability to analyze
multiple factors simultaneously. To address the limitations of existing research, this work
proposes a multi-faceted analysis approach. Develop a machine learning model to predict the
presence of sleep disorders based on a combination of sleep-related and lifestyle variables. The
model can assist in early detection and intervention. The dataset allows for the investigation of
sleep duration, quality, and factors influencing sleep patterns, enabling researchers to identify
trends and correlations related to sleep health.
